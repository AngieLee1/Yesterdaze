# Yesterdaze

Yesterdaze is an Android app that encourages positive thoughts by reminding users about happy memories :D

Every evening, users are asked "What was the best part of your day today?" and their response is recorded in a database.
In the morning, a randomly selected memory is shown to the user to give them a happy start to their day.

Throughout the day, whenever something memorable happens, users can record a memory or retrieve a random memory.

Our goal is to uplift users' spirits by encouraging them to frequently record happy memories and by reminding them about good times.
