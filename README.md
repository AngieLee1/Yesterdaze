# Yesterdaze

Yesterdaze is an Android app that encourages positive thoughts by reminding users about happy memories :D

Throughout the day, whenever something memorable happens, users can record a memory or retrieve a random memory at any time.

Our goal is to uplift users' spirits by encouraging them to frequently record happy memories and by reminding them about good times.
